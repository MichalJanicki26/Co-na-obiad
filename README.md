# What for dinner?

It's a small, personal project of mine, for people who don't want to decide what to eat for dinner - just click on the button and the site will randomize a recipe for you.
You can add new recipes, or choose, if you want a dinner with a special ingredient in it, or perhaps if you have a specific type of food to eat on your mind.

What to do:

- title validation
- css
- adding instructions and showing them
